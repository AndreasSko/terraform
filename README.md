# UseGalaxy.eu Terraform Plan

We've separated stuff into multiple folders for different sets of tests and expirements.

- public users probably want to consume [the public
  branch](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/terraform/tree/public) which is most
  of what is needed for VGCN and does not use DNS addresses.
- examples includes a flocking example
- vgcn is our current internal vgcn tests
