# UseGalaxy.eu Terraform Plan

We've separated stuff into multiple folders for different sets of tests and expirements.

- public users probably want to consume [the public
  branch](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/terraform/tree/public) which is most
  of what is needed for VGCN and does not use DNS addresses.
- [examples](./examples/) includes a flocking example
- [vgcn](./vgcn/) is our current internal vgcn tests
- [usegalaxy.eu](./usegalaxy.eu/) is our actual infrastructure
